## shinyMARLIN

Our open-access web application [shinyMARLIN](https://hovestadtlab.shinyapps.io/shinyMARLIN/) allows users to generate MARLIN predictions from methylation calls.

A bedMethyl table is required as input. You can generate the bedMethyl tables using [modkit](https://nanoporetech.github.io/modkit/intro_pileup.html)

Currently, the file should contain hg19 coordinates. In the future, support for additional human genome assemblies will be added. In the meantime, MARLIN can be run locally with hg19, hg38, and t2t.

An example file can be downloaded [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSM8838589&format=file&file=GSM8838589%5FRTC%5F005%5Fall%5Fcpgs%2Etxt%2Egz)
